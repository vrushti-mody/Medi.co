## Challenges we ran into

- Implementing the chatroom with socket.io
- Integrating Zoom with the project since it requires a paid account. We gave doctors the option to enter the link of the meet link instead.
- Hosting the project was difficult, since two of the three members were relatively new to deploymnet
- We had problems with the google calander API and hence we had to create a manual POC for now

## What we learned

- We learned how to integrate mongodb and use its mongoose functionality for saving to the database.
- We learned the ins and outs of using express.js and how the MVC works in express.
- Using socket.io to create a real-time messaging feature was also something that we learned.
- Learnt how to create an AI bot!
- Project management with Github

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We had a working application by the specified time frame.
- The UI of the application looks amazing.
- Good team communication
- Maintained best-practices for our Github repository and code

## What's next for Medi.co

- Implementing the Google Calander notification system
- Adding payment support in the application
- Improving the accuracy of the bot
